# Physics Notes

The toolkit encodes what the **experiment actually does**, not a generic textbook picture. Examples:

- **Doppler cooling (⁸⁸Sr⁺)**: show the cooling transition (e.g., 5s²S₁/₂ ↔ 5p²P₁/₂) and **repump** pathways (e.g., via D-manifolds) that keep population cycling.
- **Sideband cooling (⁸⁸Sr⁺)**: include the **quadrupole transition** used to address motional sidebands and accompanying **repump** transitions.
- **SPAM**: show state-prep light polarisation/selection rules where relevant, shelving/readout paths, and the **PMT window** on the timeline.

> Exact term labels and \(m_j\) ladders depend on the ion and chosen qubit manifold; the notebooks pin down the specific sublevels and transitions used in each protocol.

## What you can (and should) verify
- The **level spacing** used in your figure matches trusted data (the notebook auto-retrieves these).
- The **transition set** drawn matches your lab protocol (cooling, repump, shelving, detection).
- Timeline **stage ordering** and **durations** reflect the sequence you intend to run.
